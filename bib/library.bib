abstract = {We propose an algorithm for simultaneously detecting and locating changepoints in a time series, and a framework for predicting the distribution of the next point in the series. The kernel of the algorithm is a system of equations that computes, for each index i, the probability that the last (most recent) change point occurred at i. We evaluate this algorithm by applying it to the change point detection problem and comparing it to the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) algorithm. We find that our algorithm is as good as GLR, or better, over a wide range of scenarios, and that the advantage increases as the signal-to-noise ratio decreases.},

@article{Kulldorff2005,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ability to detect disease outbreaks early is important in order to minimize morbidity and mortality through timely implementation of disease prevention and control measures. Many national, state, and local health departments are launching disease surveillance systems with daily analyses of hospital emergency department visits, ambulance dispatch calls, or pharmacy sales for which population-at-risk information is unavailable or irrelevant. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We propose a prospective space-time permutation scan statistic for the early detection of disease outbreaks that uses only case numbers, with no need for population-at-risk data. It makes minimal assumptions about the time, geographical location, or size of the outbreak, and it adjusts for natural purely spatial and purely temporal variation. The new method was evaluated using daily analyses of hospital emergency department visits in New York City. Four of the five strongest signals were likely local precursors to citywide outbreaks due to rotavirus, norovirus, and influenza. The number of false signals was at most modest. CONCLUSION: If such results hold up over longer study times and in other locations, the space-time permutation scan statistic will be an important tool for local and national health departments that are setting up early disease detection surveillance systems.},

@article{Matteson2012,
abstract = {Change point analysis has applications in a wide variety of fields. The general problem concerns the inference of a change in distribution for a set of time-ordered observations. Sequential detection is an online version in which new data is continually arriving and is analyzed adaptively. We are concerned with the related, but distinct, offline version, in which retrospective analysis of an entire sequence is performed. For a set of multivariate observations of arbitrary dimension, we consider nonparametric estimation of both the number of change points and the positions at which they occur. We do not make any assumptions regarding the nature of the change in distribution or any distribution assumptions beyond the existence of the $\alpha$th absolute moment, for some $\alpha$ âˆˆ (0,2). Estimation is based on hierarchical clustering and we propose both divisive and agglomerative algorithms. The divisive method is shown to provide consistent estimates of both the number and location of change points under standard regularity assumptions. We compare the proposed approach with competing methods in a simulation study. Methods from cluster analysis are applied to assess performance and to allow simple comparisons of location estimates, even when the estimated number differs. We conclude with applications in genetics, finance and spatio-temporal analysis.},

abstract = {Sequential multi-chart detection procedures for detecting changes in multichannel sensor systems are developed. In the case of complete information on pre-change and post-change distributions, the detection algorithm represents a likelihood ratio-based multichannel generalization of Page's cumulative sum (CUSUM) test that is applied to general stochastic models that may include correlated and nonstationary observations. There are many potential application areas where it is necessary to consider multichannel generalizations and general statistical models. In this paper our main motivation for doing so is network security: rapid anomaly detection for an early detection of attacks in computer networks that lead to changes in network traffic. Moreover, this kind of application encourages the development of a nonparametric multichannel detection test that does not use exact pre-change (legitimate) and post-change (attack) traffic models. The proposed nonparametric method can be effectively applied to detect a wide variety of attacks such as denial-of-service attacks, worm-based attacks, port-scanning, and man-in-the-middle attacks. In addition, we propose a multichannel CUSUM procedure that is based on binary quantized data; this procedure turns out to be more efficient than the previous two algorithms in certain scenarios. All proposed detection algorithms are based on the change-point detection theory. They utilize the thresholding of test statistics to achieve a fixed rate of false alarms, while allowing changes in statistical models to be detected "as soon as possible". Theoretical frameworks for the performance analysis of detection procedures, as well as results of Monte Carlo simulations for a Poisson example and results of detecting real flooding attacks, are presented. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {Seasonal influenza epidemics are a major public health concern, causing tens of millions of respiratory illnesses and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year. In addition to seasonal influenza, a new strain of influenza virus against which no previous immunity exists and that demonstrates human-to-human transmission could result in a pandemic with millions of fatalities. Early detection of disease activity, when followed by a rapid response, can reduce the impact of both seasonal and pandemic influenza. One way to improve early detection is to monitor health-seeking behaviour in the form of queries to online search engines, which are submitted by millions of users around the world each day. Here we present a method of analysing large numbers of Google search queries to track influenza-like illness in a population. Because the relative frequency of certain queries is highly correlated with the percentage of physician visits in which a patient presents with influenza-like symptoms, we can accurately estimate the current level of weekly influenza activity in each region of the United States, with a reporting lag of about one day. This approach may make it possible to use search queries to detect influenza epidemics in areas with a large population of web search users.},

abstract = {An efficient sequential nonparametric multi- chart (multichannel) CUSUM-type detection test for detecting changes in multichannel sensor systems is proposed. While there is a wide spectrum of applications where it is necessary to consider multichannel generalizations and general statistical models in change-point detection problems, the study in this pa- per is motivated by network security. Many kinds of intrusions in computer networks lead to abrupt changes in network traffic. These changes have to be detected as rapidly as possible while maintaining a false alarm rate at a low level. Computer intru- sion detection encourages the development of a nonparametric multichannel change-point detection test that does not use exact legitimate (pre-change) and attack (post-change) traffic models. The proposed nonparametric detection procedure can be effec- tively applied to detect a wide variety of attacks such as exter- nal denial of service attacks, worm based attacks, port scanning, and insider man-in-the-middle attacks. Operating characteris- tics of the proposed multichannel CUSUMtest are evaluated for real denial of service attacks using traces recently collected by CAIDA. The results of a comparison with a conventional single- channel CUSUM algorithm show that the multichannel test has much better performance.},

We consider the case where no accurate nor tractable model can be found, using a model-free approach, called Kernel change detection (KCD). KCD compares two sets of descriptors extracted online from the signal at each time instant: The immediate past set and the immediate future set. Based on the soft margin single-class Support Vector Machine (SVM), we build a dissimilarity measure in feature space between those sets, without estimating densities as an intermediary step. This dissimilarity measure is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the Fisher ratio in the Gaussian case. Implementation issues are addressed; in particular, the dissimilarity measure can be computed online in input space. Simulation results on both synthetic signals and real music signals show the efficiency of KCD.},
