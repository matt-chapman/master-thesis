\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Abstract, Abridged}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Change point detection algorithms are useful!
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Manufacturing process control
            \item IT infrastructure fault \& intrusion detection
            \item etc...
        \end{itemize}
        \item Lots of approaches exist, using various test statistics, \alert{but}: \pause
        \item Which one is `best' for a situation? How is this measured? Are the measures reliable?
        \item This thesis shows that established metrics behave \alert{inconsistently} in many situations
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Research Questions}
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Are existing metrics in the field of change point detection effective and accurate?
        \begin{enumerate}
                \item In what way are existing metrics deficient when applied to change point detection problems?
    \item Do existing metrics agree on the `best' approach when used to evaluate change point detection algorithms applied to real-world data?
    \item Is there a metric more suited than the others, for the purpose of evaluating change point detections according to functional requirements set forth by the host company?
    \item What would an ideal metric for evaluating change point detection approaches look like?
    \item Do metrics show that change point detection is a reasonable and effective approach for the use-case of the host organisation?
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
