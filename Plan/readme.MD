# Thesis Plan

This folder contains the plan for the thesis project, as it was conceived prior to starting.

# Important

This plan is significantly outdated and refers to a project where the goal was to implement change detection techniques.

The project has now pivoted towards evaluating existing algorithms, and evaluating the evaluations (so meta) that have already been done on these algorithms.

The expected result is an evaluation pipeline for change detection algorithms that is effective and meaningful when these algorithms are applied to online, time-series data.
